## Quick Start

-   **Step 2.** Install the Kusion extension for Visual Studio Code. This extension requires the VS Code 1.71+
-   **Step 3.** Begin your Kusion tour starting from [Kusion's quick start](https://kusionstack.io/docs/user_docs/getting-started/usecase).

## Features

This extension now assists Kusion operations to deliver to clouds: preview, compile, and apply. Other operations such as watching resources' traces and status are currently being developed.
